* GraphQuery optimizer combines multiple indexing backends to determine the result set most efficiently
* Support for ordering in GraphQuery
* Persistit storage adapter for local graph storage
* Metrics integration for monitoring
* Support for regular expressions in GraphQuery
* Refactoring and improvement of the locking protocol
* Renaming of type definition methods to reduce the confusion surrounding this topic (see UPGRADE for more detail)

* Added performance test suite and automatic benchmark execution framework
* Refactored attribute handling and made it explicit
* Transactions are configurable by the user
* Titan interprets relative paths in configuration files relative to the directory containing said configuration file (instead of the directory from which e.g. Gremlin was invoked)
* Attribute Handling has been refactored and extended to allow custom converters and data type checkers

*Bugfixes:*

* Cassandra compression
* Resolution of elements across transaction boundaries
* Tokenization of strings for full text search
* Explicit mapping of elasticsearch elements
* Changed index format to ensure uniqueness
* Correct limit behavior for queries
* Fixed incorrect query caching behavior
* Correct string serialization
* Correct handling of hybrid GraphQuery
* Better handling of data degradation issues

h3. Version 0.2.0 (December 24, 2012)

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.titan</groupId>
   <artifactId>titan</artifactId>
   <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
*Tested Compatibility:*

* Cassandra 1.1.3 & 1.1.4
* HBase 0.94.1
* BerkeleyDB 5.0.58
* TinkerPop (Blueprints, Gremlin, Rexster) 2.2.0

* This version is incompatible with the previous version of Titan. Please follow the [[Upgrade Instructions]] to switch to the new version.

*Features:*

* Embedded Cassandra: Titan can be embedded with Cassandra, that means, Titan starts a Cassandra node in the same JVM and uses efficient in process communication to store and retrieve data.
* [[Titan Server]]: Titan comes with a light-weight Gremlin query server.
* Streamlined configuration settings. Please review the new configuration options if you are upgrading from an older version of Titan.
* Many small performance improvements throughout the code. Please review the issue tracker and the commit log for more details.

*Bugfixes:*

* Fixed edge sorting bug which caused edges to be returned in a random order even when a vertex centric index was defined.
* Fixed id allocation bug that causes Titan to read the entire row during id allocation which can lead to id allocation failures.
* Completely refactored diskstorage package for better code quality and performance.
* Fixed edge caching bug for composite primary keys on edges.
* Fixed a number of smaller bugs. Please review the issue tracker and the commit log for more details.
