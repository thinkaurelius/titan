              <div class="content wikistyle gollum textile">
                <p>Every graph operation in Titan occurs within the context of a transaction. According to the Blueprints’ specification, each thread opens its own transaction against the graph database with the first operation (i.e. retrieval or mutation) on the graph.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="n">TitanGraph</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TitanFactory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">open</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"/tmp/titan"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">Vertex</span> <span class="n">juno</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addVertex</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">//Automatically opens a new transaction</span>

</div>

<p>In this example, a local Titan graph database is opened. Adding the vertex “juno” is the first operation (in this thread) which automatically opens a new transaction. All subsequent operations occur in the context of that same transaction until the transaction is explicitly stopped or the graph database <code>shutdown()</code> which commits all currently running transactions.</p>
<h2>Transactional Scope</h2>
<p>All graph elements (vertices, edges, and types) are associated with the transactional scope in which they were retrieved or created. Under Blueprint’s default transactional semantics, transactions are automatically created with the first operation on the graph and closed explicitly using <code>commit()</code> or <code>rollback()</code>. Once the transaction is closed, all graph elements associated with that transaction become stale and unavailable. However, Titan will automatically transition vertices and types into the new transactional scope as shown in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="n">TitanGraph</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TitanFactory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">open</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"/tmp/titan"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">Vertex</span> <span class="n">juno</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addVertex</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">//Automatically opens a new transaction</span>

</pre>
</div>

<p>Edges, on the other hand, are not automatically transitioned and cannot be accessed outside their original transaction. They must be explicitly transitioned.</p>
<div class="highlight">

</pre>
</div>

<h2>Transaction Failures</h2>
<p>When committing a transaction, Titan will attempt to persist all changes to the storage backend. This might not always be successful due to IO exceptions, network errors, machine crashes or resource unavailability. Hence, transactions can fail. In fact, transactions <strong>will eventually fail</strong> in sufficiently large systems. Therefore, we highly recommend that your code expects and accommodates such failures.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getVertices</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">iterator</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">hasNext</span><span class="o">())</span>

</div>

<p>The example above demonstrates a simplified user signup implementation where <code>name</code> is the name of the user who wishes to register. First, it is checked whether a user with that name already exists. If not, a new user vertex is created and the name assigned. Finally, the transaction is committed.</p>
<p>If the transaction fails, a <code>TitanException</code> is thrown. There are a variety of reasons why a transaction may fail. Titan differentiates between <em>potentially temporary</em> and <em>permanent</em> failures.</p>
<p>Potentially temporary failures are those related to resource unavailability and IO hickups (e.g. network timeouts). Titan automatically tries to recover from temporary failures by retrying to persist the transactional state after some delay. The number of retry attempts and the retry delay can be configured through the <a class="internal present" href="./Graph-Configuration.html">Titan graph configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Permanent failures can be caused by complete connection loss, hardware failure or lock contention. To understand the cause of lock contention, consider the signup example above and suppose a user tries to signup with username “juno”. That username may still be available at the beginning of the transaction but by the time the transaction is committed, another user might have concurrently registered with “juno” as well and that transaction holds the lock on the username therefore causing the other transaction to fail. It some cases one can recover from a lock contention failure by re-running the entire transaction.</p>
<h2>Gotchas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are started automatically with the first operation executed against the graph. One does <span class="caps">NOT</span> have to start a transaction manually. The method <code>newTransaction</code> is used to start <a class="internal present" href="./Multi-Threaded-Transactions.html">multi threaded transactions</a> only.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Transactions are automatically started under the Blueprints semantics but <strong>not</strong> automatically terminated. Transactions have to be terminated manually with <code>g.commit()</code> if successful or <code>g.rollback()</code> if not. Manual termination of transactions is necessary because only the user knows the transactional boundary. <br>
A transaction will attempt to maintain its state from the beginning of the transaction. This might lead to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded applications as illustrated in the following artificial example:</li>
</ul><div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">v</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">//Retrieve vertex, first action automatically starts transaction</span>
<span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">bothE</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">returns</span> <span class="n">nothing</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">edges</span>
<span class="c1">//thread is idle for a few seconds, another thread adds edges to v</span>
<span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">bothE</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">still</span> <span class="n">returns</span> <span class="n">nothing</span> <span class="n">because</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">transactional</span> <span class="n">state</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">beginning</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">maintained</span>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
Such unexpected behavior is likely to occur in client-server applications where the server maintains multiple threads to answer client requests. It is therefore important to terminate the transaction after a unit of work (e.g. code snippet, query, etc). For instance, <a class="internal present" href="./Rexster-Graph-Server.html">Rexster Graph Server</a> manages the transactional boundary for each gremlin query. So, the example above should be:<br><div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">v</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">//Retrieve vertex, first action automatically starts transaction</span>
<span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">bothE</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">commit</span><span class="o">()</span>
<span class="c1">//thread is idle for a few seconds, another thread adds edges to v</span>
<span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">bothE</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">returns</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">newly</span> <span class="n">added</span> <span class="n">edge</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">commit</span><span class="o">()</span>
</pre>
